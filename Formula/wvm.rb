# Homebrew formula for wvm.
#
#   brew tap tegmentum/wvm https://github.com/tegmentum/wvm
#   brew install wvm
#
# This installs the single native `wvm` binary (the WASM app is embedded). On
# first use, wvm downloads and locks a protected seed Wasmtime runtime.
#
# Releasing: build the per-platform binaries (see RELEASING in the README),
# upload them to the GitHub release as `wvm-<arch>-<os>`, then bump `version`
# and replace each `sha256` below (`shasum -a 256 wvm-<arch>-<os>`).

      On first use, wvm downloads and locks a protected seed Wasmtime runtime,
      then runs as a WebAssembly component on it. Get started with:
        wvm install latest && wvm default latest
